##### Today, more than 90% of Singapore’s food comes from abroad. What if this supply is disrupted? 

From climate change to geopolitical developments and pandemics, threats like these have increasingly affected global food production and supply in recent years. While Singapore imports our food from more than 180 countries and regions to reduce our reliance on any single source, the growing uncertainties mean that we need to do more to ensure Singapore’s food security. 

Growing food locally is important in securing our food future and building a [resilient Singapore](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/). To do this, the Singapore Food Agency is working to transform the Lim Chu Kang area into Singapore’s flagship agri-food production hub of the future.

The journey ahead will be challenging, as we contend with global threats and local constraints. Trade-offs will have to be made. As a nation, how can we collaborate, prioritise, and devise innovative solutions to collectively enhance our food security? 

Join us at our exhibition at SAFRA Choa Chu Kang this September to learn more about the Singapore Food Story, and what it takes to build an agri-food hub at Lim Chu Kang to feed our future!
