<h4>Are you a… consumer or food business?</h4>
<p>Every action can go a long way in supporting our local farmers. With our
local farms building greater capability and capacity, they will need the
corresponding consumer and commercial demand for their produce.</p>
<p>The next time you’re shopping for groceries, look out for the bright red
SG Fresh Produce badges which indicate that the produce was grown locally
by our farmers or from local farms with certification for quality assurance
or sustainable schemes.</p>

<p>You can also look out for the Farm-to-Table (FTT) Recognition Programme
logo. Launched in March 2023, the FTT Recognition Programme encourages
the Hotel, Restaurants and Catering (HoReCa) sector to use locally farmed
produce in their menus. It recognises HoReCa businesses that procure at
least 15 per cent of their fresh produce ingredients in procurement value
from local farms which produce hen shell eggs, leafy vegetable, beansprouts
or fish.</p>

<p>The FTT Recognition Programme logo is a mark of assurance and HoReCa businesses
can use it to display their commitment to use local produce and boost our
nation's food security. Food businesses can find out more about the FTT
Recognition Programme and how to apply <a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/sgfoodstory/supporting-local-produce#farm-to-table-recognition-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Are you... interested in an agri-food career?</h4>
<p>As the agri-food sector transforms towards the use of more productive,
innovative and resource efficient technologies, there will be new and growing
demand for specialists in agri- and aquaculture who are skilled in science,
engineering, and info-communications, including genetics, automation and
internet of things.</p>
<p>To develop a skilled agri-food workforce, SFA collaborates with Institutes
of Higher Learning and industry players to implement training programmes
for students and adult learners to prepare them for an exciting agri-food
career.</p>
<p>In 2022, SFA partnered Workforce Singapore and Republic Polytechnic (RP)
to launch the Career Conversion Programme for the Agri-tech Sector to equip
mid-career professionals with the relevant knowledge and skills to join
the industry as an <a href="https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary/Detail/career-conversion-programme-for-agritech-specialist" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Agri-tech Specialist</a> or
<a href="https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary/Detail/career-conversion-programme-for-agritech-operator" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Agri-tech Operator</a>. RP has also broadened the scope of its <a href="https://www.rp.edu.sg/SAS/full-time-diplomas/Details/diploma-in-biotechnology" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Diploma in Biotechnology</a>,
a Pre-Employment Training programme, to include a new specialisation track
in Food and Agrotechnology.</p>
<p>From April 2023, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will offer
a Work-Study Diploma in Agriculture &amp; Aquaculture Technology. The Diploma
will equip in-service employees and fresh ITE Nitec and Higher Nitec graduates
with engineering skills to operate high-tech agriculture and aquaculture
systems, and with knowledge for food crops cultivation and fish farm management.</p>
