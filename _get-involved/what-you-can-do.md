#### Are you a… consumer or food business?

Every action can go a long way in supporting our local farmers. With our local farms building greater capability and capacity towards Singapore’s 30 by 30 goal, they will need the corresponding consumer and commercial demand for their produce.

The Hotel, Restaurants, and Catering (HoReCa) sector and local consumers can do their part to support and buy local produce. The next time you’re shopping for groceries or looking for suppliers, look out for the bright red SG Fresh Produce badges which indicate that the produce was grown locally by our farmers or from local farms with certification for quality assurance or sustainable schemes.

In February 2022, a new Alliance for Action (AfA) on “Demand Offtake and Consumer Education” was formed, as part of the Forward SG conversation. 

Supported by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and other government agencies, the AfA will see members of the agri-food industry come together to develop solutions to increase the commercial demand of local agricultural produce, and encourage consumers to support local produce. They will co-create practical solutions to aggregate supply from farms to match the demand of the HoReCa sector, and to help consumers understand the relevance and importance of supporting local produce. 

##### Why support local?

#### Are you interested in an agri-food career?

As the agri-food sector transforms towards the use of more productive, innovative and resource efficient technologies, there will be new and growing demand for specialists in agri- and aquaculture who are skilled in science, engineering, and info-communications, including genetics, automation and internet of things. 

To develop a skilled agri-food workforce, SFA collaborates with Institutes of Higher Learning and industry players to implement training programmes for students and adult learners to prepare them for an exciting agri-food career.

In 2022, SFA partnered Workforce Singapore and Republic Polytechnic (RP) to launch the Career Conversion Programme for the Agri-tech Sector to equip mid-career professionals with the relevant knowledge and skills to join the industry as an [Agri-tech Specialist](https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary/Detail/career-conversion-programme-for-agritech-specialist) or [Agri-tech Operator](https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary/Detail/career-conversion-programme-for-agritech-operator). RP has also broadened the scope of its [Diploma in Biotechnology](https://www.rp.edu.sg/SAS/full-time-diplomas/Details/diploma-in-biotechnology), a Pre-Employment Training programme, to include a new specialisation track in Food and Agrotechnology. 

From April 2023, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will offer a Work-Study Diploma in Agriculture & Aquaculture Technology. The Diploma will equip in-service employees and fresh ITE Nitec and Higher Nitec graduates with engineering skills to operate high-tech agriculture and aquaculture systems, and with knowledge for food crops cultivation and fish farm management.
