A more food secure Singapore starts with supporting and choosing local produce.

The next time you're shopping for groceries, look out for the bright red SG Fresh Produce logo, which will indicates that the  produce was grown by our local farmers.

With the shorter distance from farm to fork, this means the produce is fresher and has a lower carbon footprint.

Find out how you can get your hands on fresh, locally farmed eggs, leafy greens, fish and more [here](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/fromSGtoSG/where-to-buy).
