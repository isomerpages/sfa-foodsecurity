##### SFA launches Stakeholder Engagement for the Lim Chu Kang Master Plan

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) [announced](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/master-plan-exercise-to-transform-lim-chu-kang-into-a-high-tech-agri-food-cluster.pdf) last year that it will embark on a holistic exercise to master plan the Lim Chu Kang (LCK) area, to create a high-tech agri-food zone that can raise food production in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner. This also supports the recently announced Singapore Green Plan’s resilient future pillar.

2 As part of the consultative process, SFA is organising a series of engagement sessions with stakeholders, including the industry and public to co-create the LCK master plan, and share their views and ideas on the future of LCK. This initiative is part of the Singapore Together movement, where the Government aims to partner Singaporeans in new ways to
design and implement ideas, programmes and policies together.

3 SFA’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lim Kok Thai said, “Local production is a key prong of our food security strategy. We envision Lim Chu Kang to be Singapore’s core agri-food hub,
which can produce more than three times its current food production capacity when redeveloped. Today marks the start of an important conversation and milestone in our journey
towards a master plan formed from the partnership between the Government, stakeholders and public. We look forward to the ideas and support to shape the future of our food story
together.”

4 The engagement sessions will be conducted from May to October 2021 in a phased approach as follows:
* Phase 1 (Stakeholder Consultation): Gather public views on food security and LCK master plan
* Phase 2 (Consensus Building): Seek ideas on the LCK master plan
* Phase 3 (Co-creation): Co-create an exciting vision for the LCK area

5 Minister for Sustainability & the Environment, Ms Grace Fu, opened the first of two large group sessions today to kickstart the engagement. The second session will be held on 31 May. These two sessions are expected to bring together about 300 participants, comprising farmers, members of the public, representatives from institutes of higher learning, and ecosystem players including agri-input companies, incubators and retailers. 

6 Participants will subsequently be selected to form workgroups to delve deeper into ideas and interest areas for the LCK master plan, and to participate in focus group discussions and curated workshops. Details of the subsequent sessions* will be shared with participants at a later date.

7 A summary of the key points of discussion from the sessions will be made available online at www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg. Members of the public who are unable to participate in the engagement sessions may also share their ideas and views for LCK on the website. Suggestions contributed by participants during the engagement sessions will be considered
by agencies towards shaping the LCK master plan.

###### *These sessions will be conducted physically and/or virtually, subject to COVID-19 guidelines.
