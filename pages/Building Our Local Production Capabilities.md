<h3>Strengthening our food security</h3>

<p>With the majority of our food imported, local production is important
to reduce our reliance on food imports. It can also mitigate the impact
of supply disruptions.</p>
<p>That is why we're working towards building up our agri-food industry's
capability and capacity - so our local farms can grow more food with fewer
resources while protecting our environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>83% of those polled in our recent survey think it is important for Singapore
to be able to produce her own food to reduce reliance on imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With just 1% of Singapore’s land set aside for farming given the many
competing land needs, the agri-food industry will need to significantly
uplift its productivity in the coming years. To overcome our land and resource
constraints, some of our farmers have turned to technology and innovative
ways to increase production.</p>
<p>For example, some farms are using indoor multi-storey LED lighting and
recirculating aquaculture systems to produce 10 to 15 times more than traditional
farms!</p>

<h4>Transforming Our Agri-Food Industry</h4>
<p>To support the industry in its transformation into one that is highly
productive, climate-resilient, and resource-efficient, SFA is employing
the following strategies:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Holistic planning of the Lim Chu Kang area to <a href="https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/master-planning-lck/ourvision" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">optimise food production</a> and
expansion of <a href="https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/uplifting-aquaculture-industry/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sustainable fish farming</a> in
the deeper southern waters of Singapore;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting the agri-food sector to transform into one that is highly productive,
climate-resilient and resource-efficient through the Agri-Cluster Transformation
(ACT) fund;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ACT fund supports farms’ needs in different aspects, such as capability
upgrade, innovation and test-bedding, as well as tech upscaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing funding support for innovative research projects in sustainable
urban food production, future foods, and food safety science and innovation,
through the Singapore Food Story R&amp;D Programme which was allocated
more than $309 million of funds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rallying citizens to play a part through branding and promotion of local
produce, which enables local farms to grow their business sustainably;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with Institutes of Higher Learning to offer courses to develop
a skilled agri-food workforce and provide good jobs for Singaporeans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond increasing local food production, we are also diversifying our
food import sources to reduce the risk of reliance on any single source.
