### Lim Chu Kang Master Plan
##### 1. I missed the signups for the Lim Chu Kang Master Plan Public Engagement sessions. Can I still participate?

Our sign ups have ended for now. For those who are unable to join the engagement sessions, we welcome you to share your ideas and suggestions [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/60829e0cc3ed7d0011ad49db). You can also bookmark this site or follow our Facebook page for updates on the engagement sessions.

##### 2. Why is SFA embarking on this exercise to master plan Lim Chu Kang?
Given Singapore’s land scarcity and many competing needs, about 1% of land is set aside for agricultural use. While we will continue to identify alternative spaces to produce food, such as the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks, we will need to optimise and intensify our agricultural land to grow more with less. 

The redevelopment of the Lim Chu Kang area will enable us to uplift the local agri-food sector and develop sustainable, highly productive and industry-leading farms of the future. This will strengthen our food security and create good, green jobs for Singaporeans. 

##### 3. How will the redeveloped Lim Chu Kang area contribute towards our '30 by 30' goal? 

Currently, an average vegetable farm in Singapore occupies around 2 hectares of land and produces about 130 tonnes/ha/year. In contrast, a high-tech, high productivity vegetable farm has the potential to produce over 1,000 tonnes/ha/year with less than one hectare of land. 

When redeveloped, the Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster can potentially produce more than three times its current food production capacity. This will contribute substantially to our ‘30 by 30’ goal and efforts in boosting our food security.

##### 4. When will development works for the Lim Chu Kang area commence?

Development works are expected to commence in 2024 and will be carried out in phases.
