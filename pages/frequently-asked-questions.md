### Lim Chu Kang Master Plan


##### 1. Why is SFA embarking on this exercise to master plan Lim Chu Kang?
Given Singaporeâ€™s land scarcity and many competing needs, about 1% of land is set aside for agricultural use. We will need to optimise and intensify our agricultural land to grow more with less. 

The redevelopment of the Lim Chu Kang area will enable us to uplift the local agri-food sector and develop sustainable, highly productive and industry-leading farms of the future. This will strengthen our food security and create good, green jobs for Singaporeans. 

##### 2. How will the redeveloped Lim Chu Kang area contribute towards building up local production? 

Currently, an average vegetable farm in Singapore occupies around 2 hectares of land and produces about 130 tonnes/ha/year. In contrast, a high-tech, high productivity vegetable farm has the potential to produce over 1,000 tonnes/ha/year with less than one hectare of land. 

When redeveloped, the Lim Chu Kang agri-food zone can potentially produce more than three times its current food production capacity, further boosting our food security.
