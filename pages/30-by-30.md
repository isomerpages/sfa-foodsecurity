### A more food secure Singapore 

![](/images/SAT.jpg)

With majority of our food imported, local production is important to balance our reliance on food imports. It can also provide a buffer in the event of supply disruptions. 

This is why we're working towards **'30 by 30’** — to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally by 2030. As set out in the Singapore Green Plan, this will help build up a more resilient  future through local food production.

To overcome our land and resource constraints, some of our farmers have turned to technology and innovative ways to increase production. 

For example, some farms are using indoor multi-storey LED lighting and recirculating aquaculture systems to produce 10 to 15 times more than traditional farms!

#### Towards '30 by 30'

To support  local farms grow and expand, the Singapore Food Agency has introduced funding schemes. For example, a $60 million [Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/funding-schemes/act-fund) which provides funding support for farms to build and expand their production capabilities and capacities was launched this year. Over $23 million in funding was also awarded for [R&D in sustainable urban food production](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sfa-23-million-sustainable-urban-food-production-research-grant-14697664).

At the same time, we will master plan the Lim Chu Kang area into a high-tech, highly productive and resource-efficient agri-food cluster. 

We are also looking into the expansion of sustainable fish farming in the deeper Southern Waters of Singapore and transforming the coastal fish farms in the Straits of Johor to boost local fish production.

Beyond increasing local food production, we are also **diversifying our sources of food imports** which reduces the risk of reliance on any one single food source. Today, we import from over 170 countries and regions! 

In addition, we are **growing overseas** —  helping local companies expand overseas and export food back. 

Together, these three strategies — also known as our three food baskets, help ensure we have a secure supply of safe food in Singapore.
