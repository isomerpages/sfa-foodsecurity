As recently as 10 years ago, we would not have thought it possible to produce a substantial portion of our food on just 1% of our land area. Today, thanks to technology, some of our farms have found ways to grow much more with less land. 

For example, some farms have tapped on technology such as indoor multi-storey LED lighting and recirculating aquaculture systems to produce 10 to 15 times more than traditional farms!

*In 2020, our local farms produced about 14% of the vegetables, 8% of the fish, and 28% of the hen eggs we consumed.*

To support our local farms in adopting technology, the Singapore Food Agency has introduced funding schemes. For example, a $60 million Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund which provides funding support for farms to build and expand their production capabilities and capacities was launched this year. Over $23 million in funding was also awarded for R&D in sustainable urban food production.

At the same time, we will be master planning the Lim Chu Kang area into a high-tech, highly productive and resource-efficient agri-food cluster. We are also looking into the expansion of sustainable fish farming in the deeper Southern Waters of Singapore to boost local fish production.   

With majority of our food imported, raising local production is important to balance our reliance on food imports and can provide a buffer in the event of supply disruptions.

Beyond increasing local food production, we are also **diversifying our sources of food imports** which reduces the risk of reliance on any one single food source. Today, we import from over 170 countries and regions! In addition, we are **growing overseas** —  helping local companies expand overseas and export food back. 

Together, these three strategies — also known as our three food baskets, help ensure we have a secure supply of safe food in Singapore.
