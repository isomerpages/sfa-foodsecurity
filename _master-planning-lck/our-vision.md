### Growing more with less, sustainably

To strengthen our food security, we are embarking on a holistic exercise to master plan the Lim Chu Kang area into a high-tech agri-food zone that can raise food production in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner.

By master planning Lim Chu Kang, we can re-parcel existing plots to optimise land use, develop infrastructure to support productive farming, and establish shared facilities such as waste treatment plants or packing facilities to achieve economies of scale.

We will also explore how we can introduce circular economy principles such that where possible, the by-products of farms can be used as inputs for other parts of the agri-food eco-system. 

While agri-food production will be the key focus of the master plan exercise, we will consider how best to incorporate and support elements to engage the public, such as farmers’ markets and educational tours of the farms.

When redeveloped, the Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster can potentially produce more than three times its current food production capacity. This will contribute substantially to our '30 by 30’ goal and efforts in boosting our food security.
