**Transforming the agri-food sector**

![](/images/netatech.png)

We will be embarking on a holistic exercise to master plan the Lim Chu Kang area to create a high-tech, highly productive and resource-efficient agri-food cluster. 

We envision that the redeveloped Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster will produce more than three times its current food production. 

This will contribute substantially to our ’30 by 30’ goal and efforts to ensure Singapore’s food security.
