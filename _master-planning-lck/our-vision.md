### Growing more with less, sustainably

To strengthen our food security, we are embarking on a holistic exercise to master plan the Lim Chu Kang area into a high-tech, highly productive and resource-efficient agri-food cluster.

As part of our master plan exercise, we will look into the development of shared facilities to achieve economies of scale and enable better use of resources, as well as put in place water, electric and transport infrastructure to support high-tech farming systems. 

This will provide farms with the necessary infrastructure and support to scale up and boost production.

We will also explore how we can conserve the use of resources and minimise waste by adopting circular economy principles. 

While agri-food production will be the key focus of the master plan exercise, we will consider how best to incorporate and support elements to engage the public, such as farmers’ markets and educational tours.

When redeveloped, the Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster can potentially produce more than three times its current food production capacity. This will contribute substantially to our '30 by 30’ goal and efforts in boosting our food security.
