#### **Transforming the agri-food sector**

We will be embarking on a holistic exercise to master plan the Lim Chu Kang area to create a high-tech, highly productive and resource-efficient agri-food cluster.  

As part of our master plan exercise, we will look into the development of shared facilities to lower costs of production and resource use, as well as put in place water, electric and transport infrastructure to support high-tech farming systems. This will provide farms with the necessary infrastructure and support to scale up and boost production.

We will also explore how we can conserve the use of resources and minimise waste by adopting circular economy principles. While agri-food production will be the key focus of the master plan exercise, we will consider how best to incorporate and support relevant elements, such as farmers’ markets and education tours.

When redeveloped, the Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster can potentially produce more than three times its current food production. This will contribute substantially to the ’30 by 30’ goal and our efforts in boosting our food security.
