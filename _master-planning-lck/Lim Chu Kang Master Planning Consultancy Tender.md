Following the stakeholder engagement series, SFA is launching an Expression of Interest (EOI) in consultancy services to support us in master planning Lim Chu Kang (LCK).  

This EOI is part of a 2-stage Request for Proposal (RFP) tender process and serves as a preliminary assessment to gauge the suitability and experience of the consultants to undertake the master plan work. 
 
**Stage 1: Expression of Interest**

At the EOI stage, potential tenderers submit proposals to express interest in undertaking the consultancy. The tenderer for the master plan consultancy services should be a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) with relevant expertise and experience to oversee and successfully develop the master plan for LCK.  Interested tenderers can refer to [Gebiz ](https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/ptn/opportunity/opportunityDetails.xhtml?code=SFA000ERF21000003) for the evaluation criteria, detailed specifications and to submit your bid.
