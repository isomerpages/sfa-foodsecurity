Following the stakeholder engagement series, SFA is launching an Expression of Interest (EOI) in consultancy services to support us in master planning Lim Chu Kang (LCK).  

This EOI is part of a 2-stage Request for Proposal (RFP) tender process and serves as a preliminary assessment to gauge the suitability and experience of the consultants to undertake the master plan work. 
 
**Stage 1: Expression of Interest**

At the EOI stage, potential tenderers submit proposals to express interest in undertaking the consultancy. The tenderer for the master plan consultancy services should be a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) with relevant expertise and experience to oversee and successfully develop the master plan for LCK.  Interested tenderers can refer to [Gebiz ](https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/ptn/opportunity/opportunityDetails.xhtml) for the evaluation criteria, detailed specifications and to submit your bid. 
 
The timeline of the EOI tender process is as follows:

**Stage 2A: Concept Master Plan (Q2 2022)**

Following the EOI, successful shortlisted MDTs will be invited to participate in Stage 2A.  For this stage, MDTs will have 8 weeks to develop a detailed Concept Master Plan for the various districts being master planned in LCK.  MDTs will have to present their Concept Master Plan to the Panel for assessment and final award.
 
**Stage 2B:  Detailed Master Plan (Q3 2022 â€“ 2023)**
 
The awarded MDT from Stage 2A will proceed to Stage 2B to work together with SFA, other government agencies and stakeholders to develop the Concept Master Plan into a Detailed Master Plan by 2023. 

We welcome interested master planners, urban designers, and architects to tender and help shape our nation's food future.
