Share with us your views on how we can enhance our food security through local food production and join our Workgroup to come up with ideas and vision for the Lim Chu Kang area.  

As a Workgroup participant, you will get to work with other participants to identify and discuss ideas to create a vibrant and attractive agri-food cluster in Lim Chu Kang, and contribute towards our food security.

You will also have the opportunity to learn from and speak with subject matter experts in the agri-food industry and gain a deeper understanding of Singaporeâ€™s food security and agri-food landscape.

This will be done over a series of Workgroup sessions conducted physically and/or virtually from May to October 2021. These include focus group discussions and curated workshops for selected participants to work on their ideas and recommendations. Proposals by the Workgroup will be reviewed and may be included in the Lim Chu Kang master plan.
