From 2 to 6 September 2023, SFA held an exhibition at SAFRA Choa Chu Kang.

The exhibit highlighted milestones of our agri-food industry, the challenges faced, and how Singapore must build our capability and capacity for local food production to ensure our food security.

At the opening on 2 September, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong [spoke about](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/DPM-Lawrence-Wong-at-the-Launch-of-the-Feeding-Our-Future-Exhibition) how global shocks and disruptions could disrupt our food supply, and that we must brace ourselves for more disruptions to come. To make our food supply more resilient, one of the key strategies is to enhance local production.

Visitors got a glimpse of what the future Lim Chu Kang (LCK) could be like, with the exhibition featuring design ideas for the LCK Concept Master Plan.

These include its potential farming practices and facilities, such as an innovative stacked farm concept which will optimise land use, a district cooling facility to provide cooling needs for farms and reduce energy consumption, and a centralised waste treatment facility to process farm waste collected from the district and reduce the negative impact on the environment.

There was also an immersive room game called ‘Build Your LCK’ where players could build their own version of LCK by making choices for different aspects of LCK, with the goal of maximising food production with limited resources. 

As the consequences unfolded, players got an insight on how different decisions can affect food production, resource consumption, land take and the environment.
