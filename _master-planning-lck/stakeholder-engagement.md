In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, SFA invited industry representatives and members of the public to join us in co-creating our vision for Lim Chu Kang. This initiative is part of our ongoing efforts to invite stakeholders to share their views and ideas on how we can raise food production in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

From May to October 2021, stakeholders came together in a series of engagement sessions to identify and discuss ideas to redevelop Lim Chu Kang into Singapore’s flagship agri-food production hub of the future that is vibrant, innovative, sustainable, and accessible to all.

#### **Phase 1 & 2: Stakeholder Consultation and Consensus Building**

Over four sessions from May to June, over 300 stakeholders participated in Phase 1 of the Lim Chu Kang Master Plan (LCKMP) engagement sessions.  They came from different professions, industry and backgrounds such as farmers, educators, nature groups, solution providers, ecosystem players, members of the public and public officers gathered online to exchange views and ideas on Singapore’s food security and the Lim Chu Kang master plan.

Following the conclusion of the Phase 1 discussions, SFA invited participants to continue the LCKMP journey with us and deepen the discussion of key themes drawn from earlier conversations in Phase 2 of the Stakeholder Engagement series.  About 150 stakeholders participated in the three sessions which spanned over the month of July 2021.

Both phases were helmed by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, and Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment.

#### **Phase 3: Co-Creation**

In Phase 3, selected participants were invited to work in five dedicated groups to deepen their ideas and develop solutions.  They went through four rigorous physical and virtual sessions of problem framing, envisioning, testing and prototyping on the 4 ‘Es’ – Environment, Experience, Engagement and Economics.  Collectively, these four ‘Es’ make up a fifth ‘E’ – the Lim Chu Kang Ecosystem.
