In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, we invite the public and industry to work with us to co-create our vision for Lim Chu Kang.

Over the next few months, we will be organising a series of engagement sessions for all stakeholders to come together to identify and discuss ideas to create a vibrant agri-food zone.
