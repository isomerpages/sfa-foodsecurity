In the spirit of the Singapore Together movement, SFA invited industry representatives and members of the public to join SFA in co-creating our vision for Lim Chu Kang.

From May to October 2021, stakeholders will come together in a series of engagement sessions to identify and discuss ideas to redevelop Lim Chu Kang into Singapore’s flagship agri-food production hub of the future that is vibrant, innovative, sustainable, and accessible to all.

#### **Phase 1: Stakeholder Consultation**

Over four sessions from May to June, over 300 stakeholders from different professions, industry and backgrounds such as farmers, educators, nature groups, solution providers, ecosystem players, members of the public and public officers gathered online to exchange views and ideas on Singapore’s food security and the Lim Chu Kang master plan. The sessions were helmed by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, and Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment.
 
######  ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/phase%201.png)Around 300 participants came together over four online sessions to discuss Singapore’s food future and the Lim Chu Kang master plan.  
 
 Participants were asked to identify the opportunities and challenges in securing Singapore’s food future and how Lim Chu Kang could contribute towards Singapore’s food security.  
 
##### A) Balancing different needs and priorities
* With only about 1% of land set aside for agriculture, participants acknowledged that food production would have to be prioritised over other aspects for food security.
* Notwithstanding, we would need to balance the need to protect the nature, ecology and biodiversity of the area vis-à-vis our development plans for Lim Chu Kang, so that food production is not done at the expense of our environment. 
* Participants also discussed opportunities to incorporate environment conservation, education and community outreach, to develop Lim Chu Kang into an attractive place to work, play and learn.

##### B) Building a shared and sustainable ecosystem 
* Participants felt that there was an opportunity to develop an end-to-end ecosystem in Lim Chu Kang, with supporting infrastructure and peripheral industries in the vicinity. They suggested that shared facilities could be situated within Lim Chu Kang to reduce the cost of resources such as water and power.
* Participants also raised the importance of sustainability in food production methods and suggested the establishment of a circular system in Lim Chu Kang that would reduce resource use and waste. 
* They also suggested that we could earmark Lim Chu Kang as a space for the exchange of knowledge, skills and experience between different generations of farmers.  

##### C) Enhancing the vibrancy and accessibility of Lim Chu Kang
* Participants highlighted the importance of improving the accessibility and connectivity of Lim Chu Kang.
* They also suggested enhancements to infrastructure for water and electricity to support high-tech and productive farming systems.
* Overall, participants felt that there was opportunity to position Lim Chu Kang as an attractive location that offers accessibility, connectivity, food options and activities to cater to the different interests of Singaporeans.

##### D) Building capabilities and capacity 
* Participants noted that while we grow our produce locally, some of the raw materials for production such as seeds are still largely imported. There is hence a need to strengthen the supply resilience of these raw materials.
* To enhance food production, participants suggested for Lim Chu Kang to house R&D centres and to create a sandbox and provide space for businesses to test-bed their innovations and ideas.
* Participants shared possibilities for technology and innovation to help farmers increase their yield as they scale up their production. 

##### E) Public education about local produce and rebranding the farming industry
* Another challenge highlighted by participants identified was ensuring that there was demand for  local produce. Participants suggested that Lim Chu Kang could play a role in increasing awareness of local produce and educating the public on our food sources. 
* On the farming industry, participants highlighted the need for a change in the perception of the industry in order to attract and encourage youths to take up a career in agriculture. 
* Participants also discussed ways to excite the younger generation to join the industry and how we the transformation of our farming industry could brand and place Singapore’s agri-food sector on the world map.

#### Phase 2: Consensus Building 

Following the conclusion of Phase 1 discussions, SFA will be inviting participants to continue to share their ideas as part of our Phase 2 engagement series due to commence in July 2021. 

Participants will be invited to further discuss key themes drawn from the earlier conversations and address how Lim Chu Kang could be redeveloped into Singapore’s flagship agri-food production hub of the future that is vibrant, innovative, sustainable, and accessible to all.
