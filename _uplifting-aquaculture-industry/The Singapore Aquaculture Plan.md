SFA will be uplifting the aquaculture industry in the coming years through our Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP).  Through the SAP, we will focus on productive and sustainable production and unlock the full potential of sea-based fish farming. Strategies include:




##### Unlocking and Optimising Sea Spaces for Aquaculture

As with land, our sea space faces competing uses, such as for maritime, aquaculture, infrastructure and utilities, industry, heritage, education and recreation. We therefore need to ensure that sea spaces allocated to aquaculture are utilised in an optimal way.
