#### Singapore's Aquaculture Industry

###### ![](/images/PRIME_Threadfin%20Harvesting%20DSC_9380.jpg) Harvesting of Threadfins, one of the commonly grown fish species locally on Prime Aquaculture Farm.

Fish is a commonly consumed source of protein that can be grown locally in a productive and sustainable manner. With over 100 aquaculture farms in Singapore, the aquaculture sector plays an important role in strengthening our food security as local food production mitigates our reliance on imports and serves as a buffer during supply disruptions from import sources, which is an increasing concern amid climate change. 

SFA plans to uplift the local aquaculture industry in a productive and sustainable manner. This is part of our [30 by 30 goal](https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/30by30) - to build the industryâ€™s capability and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030.
